\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
The results are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \ref{itm:H1} (Total Score)---Statistically, the average score in conditions \ref{itm:C1}, \ref{itm:C2}, and \ref{itm:C3} was significantly higher than in condition \ref{itm:C1}. This is illustrated in Tab.~\ref{tab:H1}.
    \item \ref{itm:H2} (Higher Trust)---Statistically, the average score in conditions \ref{itm:C1}, \ref{itm:C2}, and \ref{itm:C3} was significantly higher than in condition \ref{itm:C1}. This is illustrated in Tab.~\ref{tab:H2}.
    \item \ref{itm:H3} (Average Time)---Statistically, the average score in conditions \ref{itm:C1}, \ref{itm:C2}, and \ref{itm:C3} was significantly higher than in condition \ref{itm:C1}. This is illustrated in Tab.~\ref{tab:H3}.
    \item \ref{itm:H4} (System Quality)---Statistically, the average score in conditions \ref{itm:C1}, \ref{itm:C2}, and \ref{itm:C3} was significantly higher than in condition \ref{itm:C1}. This is illustrated in Tab.~\ref{tab:H4}.
    \item \ref{itm:H4} (Willingness to Use Again)---Statistically, the average score in conditions \ref{itm:C1}, \ref{itm:C2}, and \ref{itm:C3} was significantly higher than in condition \ref{itm:C1}. This is illustrated in Tab.~\ref{tab:H5}.
\end{enumerate}

Add some plots out outcomes, also add tables showing statistics and significance.

\brett{discuss insights from results, i.e. trust--accoring to some measures--wasn't affected, but behavior \textbf{WAS}.}
