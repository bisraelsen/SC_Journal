\section{Factorized Machine-Self Confidence}

This section presents our algorithmic meta-analysis framework for assessing and communicating machine self-confidence, known as \textit{Factorized Machine Self-confidence (\famsec{})}.  \nisar{for me todo: finish this thought/roadmap:}...ideas were first sketched out in \cite{Aitken2016-cv}, which also proposes initial basis for factor calculation; this work further develops the calculation methods (in particular relaxing a key assumption from the previous work that exact optimal policy is available...) and validates them on human trials... First we present overview of \famsec{}, then dive into details for how to compute two basic factors that relate blah blah blah...before we then evaluate in user trials in Section blah...
